! AirflowNetwork_MultiZone_SmallOffice_VAV.idf
! Basic file description:  1 story building divided into 3 interior conditioned zones and 1 unconditioned zone over the
!                          conditioned zones. Roof with no plenum. No ground contact with floor.
!                          Outdoor air is modulated based on occupancy and floor area.
!
! Highlights:              This file does the basic test of an air distribution system with a VAV central system using
!                          the AiflowNetwork model. It simulates multizone aiorflows driven by wind and a VAV supply fan,
!                          and energy losses from leaks and conduction in an air distribution system.
!
!
! Simulation Location/Run: CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846, 2 design days, 2 run periods,
!                          Run Control executes the design days only.
!
! Location:                Chicago, IL
!
! Design Days:             CHICAGO_IL_USA Annual Heating 99% Design Conditions DB, MaxDB= -17.3?C
!                          CHICAGO_IL_USA Annual Cooling 1% Design Conditions, MaxDB=  31.5?C MCWB=  23.0?C
!
! Run Period (Weather File): Winter 1/14, Summer 7/7, CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846
!
! Run Control:             Zone and system sizing, design day simulation.
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular L-shaped building 40 ft south wall, 40 ft west wall, zone height 10 feet.
!           There is a single window in West Zone's south wall. The walls are 1 in stucco over 4 in common brick
!           and gypboard. The ceilings consist of 1 in dense insulation
!           and 3/4" gypsum drywall. A unconditioned attic zone is over three conditioned zones with height 3 feet.
!           The roof is a built up roof with 1/2 in stone over 3/8 in felt supported by 2 in heavy weight concrete.
!           The window to wall ratio is approxomately 0.07.
!
!           There is a duct system with about 5% supply leaks and 5% return leaks.
!           Supply ducts are located in the attic zone and return ducts are exposed to outdoors.
!           Both supply and return conduction losses occur in the attic zone.
!
!           There is daylighting through the window in West Zone. The window has double-pane electrochromic
!           (switchable) glazing in which the outer pane darkens automatically to control daylight glare.
!           Spectral (wavelength by wavelength) data are used for the optical properties
!           of the inner pane of the double glazing. Spectral average properties are used
!           for the outer (electrochromic) pane.
!
!           The window also has a frame and divider. The 2-D glass conduction effects near
!           the frame and divider ("edge-of-glass effects") are taken into account.
!
!           The overhead electric lighting has continuous dimming control. The zone has a
!           single daylighting control point ("reference point") with an illuminance set point
!           of 500 lux (about 50 footcandles). The reference point is located at the center of
!           the zone at desk height. The other zones have no windows and so have no daylighting controls.
!           Note that Clearness for the winter design day is not 0.0, as in the other sample inputs,
!           but 1.0. This turns on solar radiation in order to show the effect of daylighting in the winter.
!           (With Clearness = 0 all daylighting illuminances are zero)
!
!           The building is oriented due north.
