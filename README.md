# VCVTB
Welcome to the github repository of VCVTB, The Ventilation Controls Virtual Test Bed

VCVTB is an opensource EnergyPlus 8.8.0 based virtual test bed for the accelerated modelling, testing and comparing of single and mixed mode ventilation systems and their control strategies. It originated from the doctoral research of ir.arch. Bert Belmans under the supervision of prof.dr.ir.arch Filip Descamps.

Until now, VCVTB v.1.0.0 is made available in this repository "as it is". 
Comments, paths and files will be updated and translated in English on a dropwise basis.
For privacy reasons current paths and passwords are anonymised. They will be adapted to generic paths in the future.

In the meanwhile feel free to take a look around. 

I thank you for your patience,

Bert Belmans
