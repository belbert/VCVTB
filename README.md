# VCVTB
Welcome to the github repository of VCVTB, The Ventilation Controls Virtual Test Bed

VCVTB is an opensource EnergyPlus based virtual test bed for the accelerated modelling, testing and comparing of single and mixed mode ventilation systems and their control strategies. It originates from the doctoral research of ir. arch. Bert Belmans under the supervision of prof. dr. ir. arch. Filip Descamps.

Points of Attention
--------------------------

- The Book of VCVTB provides a first overview of functionalities and dependencies.
- A compiled custom EnergyPlus version can be found in the CORE Folder.
- Due to the size of the test bed comments, paths and files will be added, updated and translated in English on a dropwise basis.
- VCVTB has a folder-based OpenFOAM-like setup. For privacy reasons original paths and passwords are anonymised. They will be adapted to generic paths in the future.

Referencing
--------------------------

For now please reference VCVTB by referring to this repository.

An Original Research Paper containing an overview of VCVTB and the reason why it was created was recently submitted to the international journal "Building and Environment. At the moment it is pending for approval. Upon acceptance, a reference will be placed here. It is titled "Set-up and Evaluation of a Virtual Test Bed for Simulating and Comparing Single-and Mixed-Mode Ventilation Strategies."

A doctoral thesis concerning VCVTB will also be made available after the public PhD defence. This will hopefully happen end March/ early April 2019.

Remarks
--------------------------

- VCVTB v.1.0.0 is dropwise made available in this repository "As it is". 
- I will post weekly updates until the entire platform is online, but at the moment my focus is on finalizing the text of my PhD research. Priority is given to complementing "The Book of VCVTB" in the main folder, because it doesn't seem very useful to throw a lot of scripts online without the required user guidelines.

For the time being, feel free to take a look around, ask questions and make suggestions.
